\title{Call a function on each node of a cluster}
\usage{
cluster_call(cluster, code, ptype = list())

cluster_send(cluster, code)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster}{A cluster.}

\item{code}{An expression to execute on each worker.}

\item{ptype}{Determines the output type. The default returns a list,
which will always succeed. Set to a narrower type to simplify the output.}
}
\value{
A list of results with one element for each worker in `cluster`.
}
\description{
`cluster_call()` executes the code on each worker and returns the results;
`cluster_send()` executes the code ignoring the result. Jobs are submitted
to workers in parallel, and then we wait until they're complete.
}
\examples{
cl <- default_cluster()

# Run code on each cluster and retrieve results
cluster_call(cl, Sys.getpid())
cluster_call(cl, runif(1))

# use ptype to simplify
cluster_call(cl, runif(1), ptype = double())

# use cluster_send() to ignore results
cluster_send(cl, x <- runif(1))
cluster_call(cl, x, ptype = double())
}
